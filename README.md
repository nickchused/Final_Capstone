# Final_Capstone
My final capstone predicts the price someone can expect to pay for a rental property in New York City through the Airbnb marketplace.  Using a large NYC Airbnb dataset, I have analyzed a variety of features, such as room type, borough, neighborhood, number of listings by the host, and year-round availability, to predict the cost per night of a given rental property.  The end product of my research provides the user with the ability to input the features they're looking for in a NYC Airbnb and then get a rough estimate of their expected cost per night for a rental property that fits their criteria.
